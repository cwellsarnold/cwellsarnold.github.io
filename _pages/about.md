I am a professor and the Vice Chair of Research in the UCLA Department of Radiological Sciences and hold joint appointments in the Departments of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Electrical & Computer Engineering, and Bioengineering. I lead the Computational Diagnostics lab, a team focused on developing AI methods to improve healthcare. 

I received my PhD in Information Science from UCLA and my BS in Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
